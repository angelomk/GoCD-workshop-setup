# 2016-GoCD-workshop

Use this to create and run a Virtualbox to be used for the GoCD Workshop. 

1. Make sure you have Vagrant and Virtualbox
2. Clone this repository
3. Run 'vagrant up' (this will take a while, it builds most of the box)

The GoCD instance will be set to poll https://github.com/gocd-demo/2016-GoCD-workshop-application for pipeline changes.
